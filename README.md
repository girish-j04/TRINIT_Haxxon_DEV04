1. ### Clone the repo to your system.
`git clone https://github.com/girish-j04/TRINIT_Haxxon_DEV04.git`

2. ### Install the node packages.
`npm install`

### **Note: If you haven't installed chrome on the default location, add the correct path to the bharatx.js file on line 42 before running the bharatx.js file.**

3. ### Add the Email Ids to ./csvfiles/contacts.csv file. 
**Note that multiple email ids can be fed into the csv file, but only after the dummy id "1aaa@aaa.com" and also do not change the "E-mail Address" header and the dummy email id in the file.**

4. ###  Open keys.js and update the value of the variable "email_count" to the number of email ids you have given.

5. ### Now run the bharatx.js script in the same directory.
`node bharatx`

6. ### The linkedin url associated with the given email id will be printed on the command line.
